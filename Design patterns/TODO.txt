Crucial to the task:
@todo `add` command
@body ...
- handle quoted values in `find`
- add objects to dictionaries in constructors

Cleanup & cosmetic changes:
- Exception Invalid argument: print which and command's usage
- `help` command, ToString() methods
- Prettier object printing? Reference fields
- In Filterable.cs: The part of each class implementing IFilterable should be put into some kind of seperate abstract classes. Additionally each of them should inherit the same Get...ByName implementations
- In Commands.cs: Merge `list` and `find` commands.
- In IteratorLab.cs: Indexer of any nth element using ceil(sqrt(n))
