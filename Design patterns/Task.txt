In this task, you need to modify the behaviour of a previously added command queue. 
All commands should be now executed immediately without committing. All queue commands 
(commit, dismiss, print) should be removed except for queue export and queue load, 
which should be renamed to just "export" and "load" and export/load all executed commands. 
You should keep a history of all executed commands and implement the following:

1. history - list all executed commands

2. undo - reverts the changes made by the most recently executed command

3. redo - reapplies the changes made by the most recently undone command

As already mentioned, the program should keep a "command history" to
allow for multiple undo/redo steps.

Note that your solution should be easily extensible in terms of supporting
undo/redo operations for newly added commands.
